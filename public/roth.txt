Dear Professor Roth, 
I am currently taking your 262 class. Lately I've been finding it difficult to keep up with the material/assignment due this Thursday because I am suffering from a concussion. I got hit in a rugby game about a week and a half ago (Oct 30th), and I have been having more or less continuous headaches since then and often find it hard to concentrate. Do you have any suggestions for how I can get back on track? I can't make it to your regular office hours because I have class T-Thr 1:30-3, but I was wondering if we could meet some time to go over the material from the past couple lectures. Are you free at all tomorrow? I would have talked to you sooner, but I didn't realize it how long it takes to heal. I thought I could finish hw2 in time, but at this point, I only have 3 out of 7 questions completed. 

Thanks,
Anna
